                <p> My name is Imanol Matos and this is Monte Rio Route, I am student from the province of Azua and I am
                    the leader of Monte Rio Route. This project is inspired by my connection with nature and my love for
                    discovering unique places.
                    Monte R√≠o Route is an invitation to explore and enjoy the beauty of the Beaches of Azua, the
                    landscapes, and
                    culture, blending adventure, photography, and a healthy lifestyle. Monte Rio Route consists of the
                    beaches: "Monte Rio", "Uvitas","Blanca", and "El Barco".</p>
